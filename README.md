# .github

The .GitHub repository. A special place, it seems. A place where to hold the .git things, like our profile and our...credo? manifesto? our constitution? These words have such connotations that they don't feel right.

## What is this place?

Git is a magical place of DELTAs. Deltas are represented in science with a triangle: △ and they usually mean the difference between a thing, as a symbolic variable, which can be treated as an integer.  That's probably too much to be thrown at you all at once, but suffice to say, △ is of great importance.

### What's the Diff?

Well, that _is_ the question, afterall. See, it's important to be able to track changes across time. Documents, records of human thought, used to take up so much space on paper and in libraries. When new revisions would be published, they required changes to either printing mechanisms (retooling) or for the new revisions to be hand-copied and carefully distributed by people whose job was literally called "printer" (well, really a similar word in Middle English, but you get [the idea](#professions-to-machine-names))

So then, it becomes significant that we have devised a method to not only consolidate our thoughts into so-called bits, effectively encoded electromagnetic eigenstates...and therefore occupy almost no physical space whatsoever, but that we have come up with a very efficient method of revision management. In this way, we can have a history tracking of all the changes that ever did occur to a system of writings.

### By Menenite  

The Menenites were a family of friends, you might say. They were a Christian sect of people that were honestly quite similar to us Meta. They referred to each other as "friend" and considered friends to be family, and put [family above all else](#blood-is-thicker-than-water). The Menenites had a desire to not write down their system of beliefs, having seen what ever other major religion had already done with thier systems of belief: they had cannonized them.  In their view, this was dangerous, for when you cannonize a set of writings, then they become _code_ and they are very difficult, if not impossible, to change.  And they knew that our God was a Living God, and that our process is one of Discovery.

Therefore, the Menenites did not write down their "holy" texts, and instead insisted on verbal pass-down between generations. Sadly, this does also suffer from problems, most notably, that others cannot read and intimate thier words, stories, and understandings without a Menenite doing so personally and directly.

##### Professions to Machine Names

It's a remarkable thing that in the past, many of the machines which we modernly use, had people who performed those jobs, and whose professions were called by the same name. For example, [Ada Lovelace](https://wikipedia.com/Ada-Lovelace) was a marvel of a mathematician, as we think of her today. However, many do not know that she was employed as a "computer" or a "calculator": literally "one who does computations" or "one who calculates." It is fitting, then, that the devices that we use today to accomplish these same tasks would be called by the same profession's name.

There were even early "printers", which were usually highly skilled and long-studied monks who spent the better part of their lives hand-copying, verbatim, page after page of a book, which would then be bound by "binders," people who bound books, into...well...books. The first printers, in our current recollection of written history, were actually humans, not machines. Does that mean then that machines are not alive?
